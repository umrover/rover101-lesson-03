I am interested in MRover because I want to work with robots as a career. I would prefer to work on robots that operate on other planets, so essentially rovers and similar bots.

I intend to work in Hardware Interface and Microcontrollers. I have a lot of background in programming, but I'm not a huge fan of high-level programming in complex projects. I would much rather be working in low-level programming and electronics. I think I might try to help with autonomous as well, since recently I have mostly worked in Python and I have experience programming for a FIRST team that might be helpful.
