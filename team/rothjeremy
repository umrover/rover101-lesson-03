I am looing to gain some hands on experience in robotics and team-based projects. I have never been a part of a design team, so I am excitied to part of the total devolpment cycle for a project.

I am hoping to be able to spend some time on both the Hardware and Microcontrollers subteam as well as autonomous navigation. My background has primarily been in computer vision, however I am looking to gain some experience in hardware intergration and embedded systems.
