I love space exploration and wanted to find a way to expand my knowledge of computer science in a way that allowed me to explore other interests and challeneged me to learn more than I will in class. I also want experience working on a large scale project that heavily involves programming.

I hope to get some expereince working with the autonomous driving part of the rover.
