Sophomore Computer Science

I was interested in learning how programming would work on an actual machine. Before I joined this team, all of my projects were either completely computer based, or used very simple arduino systems (like detecting when a button is pressed). I want to learn how a programmer works on a larger and more complecated system.

I'd be open to any role, but I'm currently looking into the Teleops/Communication team.
